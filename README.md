# A Novel Protective Role of Astrocytic GFAP in Tau Proteostasis

## About

Astrocytes react to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and phospho-tau (pTau) neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain but their effects on these AD neuropathological hallmarks remain controversial. Here we have unraveled a novel role of the intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) — a classic marker of reactive astrocytes — in the clearance of pTau aggregates with potentially beneficial effects in synaptic integrity. The overexpression of GFAP in astrocytes from a tauopathy mouse model reduced hippocampal mature NFT burden and increased synaptophysin levels while lowering neuronal cFos expression, especially in female mice. Mechanistically, increasing GFAP levels induced the expression of extracellular matrix genes and GFAP co-immunoprecipitated many proteostasis interactors including members of the endocytic pathway, autophagy, chaperones, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These findings suggest a protective role of this feature of reactive astrocytes in neuron-to-neuron tau propagation.
